<h2>Sylvia Ani</h2> 

<p>
I am an aspiring software engineer and a student of Holberton School. I created this Calendar TO-DO App, with the aim of making people become more productive with themselves daily and also utilizing their time effectively. As someone who procrastinates a lot, I used myself as a source of inspiration to design this project. I also gathered data in trying to estimate how my app would make an effect globally by speaking to people. I finally came to a conclusion that people find it strenous to manage their 24 hours, which of course is where my app comes in.
<br>
The app is designed to allow users schedule their daily tasks and even for future projects. I created this app on February, 2024 and of course as a courtesy to the Holberton School and ALX.
<br>
The app was designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript, using Node.JS and Express.JS for it's backend. I single-handedly designed this project from scratch, fitting it for all audience and age-groups. It is easy to use, navigate and user-friendly.
