<h2>Sylvia Ani</h2> 

<p>I am an aspiring software engineer and a student of Holberton School. I created this Calendar TO-DO App, with the aim of making people become more productive with themselves daily. As someone who procrastinates a lot, I used myself as a source of inspiration to design this project.
<br>
The app is designed to allow users schedule their daily tasks and even for future projects. I created this app on February, 2024 and of course as a courtesy to the Holberton School and ALX.
<br>
The app was designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript, using Node.JS and Express.JS for it's backend. I single-handedly designed this project from scratch, fitting it for all audience and age-groups. It is easy to use, navigate and user-friendly.
<br>
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, collaborations or reviews.
